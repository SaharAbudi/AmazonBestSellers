## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Amazon Bestsellers 2025 dataset, focusing on data cleaning, currency normalization, brand mapping, descriptive statistics, and visualization. The goal is to uncover insights into pricing, ratings, brand performance, and cross-country trends.

## Project Structure

## Dependencies & Installation
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## Quick Start
Place the dataset under /data.
Open the notebook or run Python scripts with the helper functions.
Adjust currency exchange rates as needed.
Execute the analysis to generate tables and visualizations.

## Dataset Description
Key columns:
product_title, product_price, product_star_rating, product_num_ratings, product_num_reviews, country, rank, asin, page.

## Data Pipeline
Price Cleaning: Extract numeric values and normalize to USD.
Currency Normalization: Map country â†’ currency, apply exchange rates.
Ratings & Reviews Cleaning: Convert to numeric, clip to valid ranges.

Correlation Matrix: Compute Spearman correlations across features (price, rating, num_ratings, rank_inv).
## Analysis & Visualizations
### Country-Level Metrics
Aggregates: item counts, average rating, average price.
Visualization: grouped barplots (rating vs price).

### Price Distribution by Country
Boxplot with log scale to highlight outliers.

### Brand Analysis
#### 1. Extract Brand Hybrid
A custom function maps product titles to brands using an alias dictionary (multi-language) with fallback heuristics.

#### 2. Brand Counts
Count of products per brand.
Visualization: barplot of Top-N brands.
Useful for focusing on statistically significant brands.

#### 3. Brand Ã— Country Crosstab
Cross-tabulation of brands by country.
Visualization: heatmap to reveal brand penetration by geography.

#### 4. Price by Brand
Boxplot (log scale) of prices by brand.
Identifies premium vs budget brands.

#### 5. Rating by Brand
Violin/Boxplot of star ratings grouped by brand.
Shows brand reputation patterns.

### Price Analysis
Distribution: Histogram + KDE and Boxplot.
Percentiles: q05 â‰ˆ 3.35, q25 â‰ˆ 16.8, q50 â‰ˆ 32.7, q75 â‰ˆ 65.4, q95 â‰ˆ 177.2.
Insight: Most products fall between $17â€“65, but a small subset of expensive products creates a long right tail.

### Ratings Analysis
Distribution: average â‰ˆ 4.14, median 4.2, range 1â€“5.
Dataset shape after cleaning ratings: (969, 13).
Insight: Ratings are clean and skewed positively, typical of Amazon.

### Correlation Matrix
Spearman correlations:
Price â†” Rating â‰ˆ +0.078 (very weak positive).
Price â†” Num Ratings â‰ˆ âˆ’0.150 (weak negative).
Rating â†” Num Ratings â‰ˆ +0.116 (weak positive).
Num Ratings â†” Rank_inv â‰ˆ +0.222 (moderate positive).
Insight: Prices are not strongly related to ratings. Number of ratings has the strongest (but still moderate) association with bestseller rank.
